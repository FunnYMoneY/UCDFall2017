Structure of program:
---------------------
File organization: ClayHW1.cpp
Functional organization: ClayHW2 contains a main .cpp and a class header and implementation
				file.
			 main() takes input & returns the desired output
			 class grid outlines a class to create 2 types of 2-dimensional
				arrays - one new, filled with zeros and ones randomly
				       - one based on two other arrays
			 grid.cpp is the implementation file for grid.h

Status: It works completely

Hardware & Platform I used: Intel core i5 1.4 GHz processor with 4GB RAM (macOS Sierra operating system)

Compile: extract the archive, and then from a shell run "make". This will create an executable “ClayHW2”. Then run ./ClayHW2
