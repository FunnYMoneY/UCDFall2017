//Begin Main
//	Ask first name
//	Ask last name
//	Ask hourly pay rate
//	Ask hours worked in week 1
//	Calculate week 1 pay:
//		If hours worked is greater than 40 hrs
//			time and a half = (hours worked - 40) * 1.5
//			week1 pay = (40 + time and a half) * hourly pay rate
//		Otherwise
//			week1 pay = hours worked * hourly pay rate
//		Ask hours worked week 2
//	Calculate week 2 pay:
//		If hours worked is greater than 40 hrs
//			time and a half = (hours worked - 40) * 1.5
//			week2 pay = (40 + time and a half) * hourly pay rate
//		Otherwise
//			week2 pay = hours worked * hourly pay rate
//	Calculate gross pay:

//	Calculate net-take-home:
//		withheld = gross pay * 0.25

//		net-take-home = gross pay - withheld - union dues
//	Output gross pay and net-take-home
